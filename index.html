            <p class="par">Welcome to our web page dedicated to putting an end to overdevelopmet in Malta, where there are<br> 
                constantly new buildings being constructed. The ongoing constructions cause not only noise but also visual<br> 
                pollution to passerbys. In order to obtain a more sustainable community, we need to restore what we laready<br> 
                have: old buildings instead of building new ones. Revive, renew, redefine!

    <h1>Contents</h1>
    <p>Explore how overdevelopment is a major issue in Malta and learn what you can do to help create a sustainable environment.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> The buildings and construction sector accounts for 37% of global emissions which is the largest emitter of 
                greenhouse gases. the carbon emissions from construction will contribute to an irreversible damage occurring 
                to the environment. The air we breathe in will be polluted and cause diseases to form. In order to stop this 
                we should refrain from building new properties for trivial reasons and instead take advantage of what we already 
                have. Currently, there are around 81,000 abandoned or currently not in use residences in Malta. Taking action 
                and renovating them to house the growing population of the country is the solution!</table></p>

         <div class="course-col">
            <h2>Overdevelopment</h1>
            <p>Overdevelopment can be seen everywhere in Malta: by looking at the unfinished new buildings and the 
                cranes at every corner of the country. This "haphazardly planned sprawl of colourless concrete development" 
                cause visual polition and lead to monotony which could cause in the decline in people's mental well being. The 
                government's efforts to establish some form of planning have ended up in vain. For instance: The Paceville masterplan 
                has been put on hold and forgotten. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h2>Take Action</h2>
            <p>In order to prevent overdevelopment in Malta, avoid buying recently built property from large companies 
                that are profitting off of the situation Malta is in. Instead, invest in properties that are older than 7 years 
                and the ones that resemble the traditional Maltese architechture. By renovating houses like these, you can 
                prevent loss of culture or even increase their worth, helping you to sell them later easier. Another way you can 
                take action is by participating in events that call for action and even donate money to organisations  that are raising money
                to restore old, abandoned buildings.</p>
