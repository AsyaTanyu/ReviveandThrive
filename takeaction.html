            <p class="par">Welcome to our web page dedicated to putting an end to overdevelopmet in Malta, where there are<br> 
                constantly new buildings being constructed. The ongoing constructions cause not only noise but also visual<br> 
                pollution to passerbys. In order to obtain a more sustainable community, we need to restore what we laready<br> 
                have: old buildings instead of building new ones. Revive, renew, redefine!

        <p>The government has made efforts such as giving incentives and paying some of the renovation bills for traditional 
            Maltese houses in order to encourage more buyers to invest in restoring these historic properties. The government 
            will refund up to €54,000 on the first €300,000 spent on renovation work for certain properties. This is eligible 
            for properties over 20 years old that have been vacant for more than 7 years.Unfortunately, buyers are often not aware 
            of this fact and think that renovating a house costs too much money and time. Therefore, they end up buying a recently 
            built house. Now that you know this, consider investing in a traditional Maltese house and see below for some already 
            renovated Maltese homes for inspiration. Renovations made simple, results made extraordinary!<br><br> Furthermore, use 
            this website for help when renovating your house or when you are buying it: https://oldhousesmalta.com/</p>
