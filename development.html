            <p class="par">Welcome to our web page dedicated to putting an end to overdevelopmet in Malta, where there are<br> 
                constantly new buildings being constructed. The ongoing constructions cause not only noise but also visual<br> 
                pollution to passerbys. In order to obtain a more sustainable community, we need to restore what we laready<br> 
                have: old buildings instead of building new ones. Revive, renew, redefine!

        <p>Due to Malta's growing population, there are constantly new properties being built. This has raised significant 
            concers as the new construction sites polluted the area. It has also overshadowed Malta's natural beauty and its 
            buildings with traditional Maltese architechture. This has caused a great loss of identity for Maltese people. These 
            traditional buildings that used to be timeless are now rotting as they are either abandoned, vacant or not taken care of. </p>

            <p>"While these 81,613 residential properties are empty or underutilized, the building industry continues 
                to build more, and the problem continues to grow. They call this progress, but it is in fact environmental 
                destruction of the little land we have to build property that is then left empty or underutilised."- Independent Newspaper<br>

                "It is worrying to hear Malta's top authorities are still speaking about the need to reclaim land or build higher 
                when neither is needed, since Malta has such a large number of empty residential units," FAA Coordinator Astrid Vella 
                told MaltaToday this week."- Malta Today Newspaper<br>
